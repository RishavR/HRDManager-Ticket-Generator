# Hall-Ticket-Generator
A simple Hall Ticket Generator software developed by me in my first year for the Govt. of Sikkim - Department of State Teacher Recruitment Board. 
Developed primarily in Java + SQLite + HTML & CSS (for formatting of Hall Ticket) 

## Pre-requisites 
You should have Java 5 or above installed in your machine to run the software.

## How to Run 
Simply run the following jar file. The rest is intuitive.

```
HRDManager.jar 
```
